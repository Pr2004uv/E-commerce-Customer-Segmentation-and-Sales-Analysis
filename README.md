# E-commerce-Customer-Segmentation-and-Sales-Analysis

This project is attractive because it tackles a core business need: understanding customers and driving sales. This will analyze an e-commerce dataset to identify top-selling products, discover purchasing patterns, and segment customers to enable targeted marketing. The dataset used here is derived from The "Online Retail" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

My objective is to answer the following:
1. What are the best-selling products and categories?
2. What is the sales trend over time (e.g., monthly, quarterly)?
3. Who are the most valuable customers?
4. What are the distinct customer segments based on their purchasing behavior?

In order to achieve this i have used the following libraries within python:
1. Pandas: For data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
2. Matplotlib & seaborn: For creating static charts and graphs.
3. Plotly: For interactive visualizations.
4. Scikit-learn: For customer segmentation using clustering (K-Means).
5. Streamlit: To build and share an interactive web app/dashboard of your findings.
